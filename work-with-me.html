      <h5>Sponsored Content on My Platforms</h5><br>
      <h4>Instagram Posts</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">With an engagement rate 300% higher than similar accounts, my followers are loyal and highly engaged with what I post. I can promote your destination, property, event, or product through elevated imagery on Instagram, tagging your brand in the caption and photo.
        </div>
      <h4>Instagram Stories</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">Stories tend to have a more authentic feel than standard posts. I can promote destinations, properties, events, or products through videos and photos while tagging your brand and using an optional dedicated branded hashtag. Stories can also be an optional add-on to sponsored posts, allowing my followers to get a "behind-the-scenes" look at promotions.
        </div>
      <h4>Blog Posts</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">If you need a more detailed, or longer-form promotion, I can offer featured blog posts for your brand. Blog posts are promoted across all of my social media platforms.
        </div>
      <h4>Facebook Posts</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">Instagram remains the most engaging option for followers to view my content, but Facebook posts can be a great compliment to promote your brand or event. I can also share your own content or blog posts to my followers through sponsored posts on my Facebook page.

      <h5>Freelancing for Your Platforms</h5><br>
      <h4>Content Creation</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">Do you need posts and/or images for your own website or social media platform? I can create digital content for your needs, whether it be Instgram posts, Instgram stories, Pinterest pins, Facebook posts, or written articles for your site.
        </div>
      <h4>Photography</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">High quality photographs for your social media platforms, website, or advertising campaigns can be created to suit your needs.
        </div>
      <h4>Web Design and Development</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">Static websites are a huge plus for your SEO and your brand. Ditch clunky, slow, and old sites and get a new static website that is lightning fast and easy to manage on your own. Search page rankings favour sites with fast loading times, increasing your exposure, and visitors to your page are less likely to abandon the site if your page loads fast.
        </div>
      <h4>Business / Brand Coaching</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">Have a great idea but not sure how to get it off the ground? Maybe you need some fresh ideas to invigorate your existing brand? From the basics of choosing your brand colours and logo, to injecting some new ideas or changing direction, together we can get your brand moving forward.
        </div>
      <h4>Social Media Management</h4>
        <div class="padded3lr">Interested in growing your own social media following, or simply want to stay engaged with your followers but don't have the time to do it? Let's work together to come up with a strategy and let me do the hard work for you! Social media management is available on Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest.
