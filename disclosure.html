      This Website also includes some links which are affiliate links, and if you choose to purchase using these links, I may receive a commission. Clicking on an affiliate link does not cost you anything, but does allow you to directly support Wanderlost + Found through the commissions that I may receive as a result of your activity on an affiliate website.

    <h5 class="padded1tb brown-text" id="commenting">Commenting on Posts</h5>
    <p>
      Commenting on blog posts is managed through a third party website/app called Disqus. Further information regarding your privacy while using Disqus can be found by reading my <a href="/privacypolicy" target="_blank"><span class="underline">Privacy Policy</span>.</a><br><br>
      Commenting on blog posts is strongly encouraged when you feel you have something to add to the conversation. I welcome comments and feedback both positive and negative and look forward to opinions that may challenge my own, however comments that I deem to be sexist, racist, misogynistic, homophobic, or are broad offensize generalizations about groups of people are strictly not allowed. Any hateful, inflammatory or harassing comments will be removed without warning. If you happen to see a comment here that you believe contradicts this rule, please report it me directly, or flag it from within the Disqus app.<br><br>
      Some comments may be subject to moderation prior to being published on this Website. Reasons why your comment may be held for moderation prior to being published include, but are not limited to, your comment containing a link, your comment being flagged by another user, if you post as a guest (without logging in to Disqus), or if you are a Disqus registered user but have not verified your email address.<br><br>
      Absolutely no self promotion is allowed. A comment that contains only a link to your blog, product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed. If you have an idea for a new blog post here, would like to guestpost with one you have previously published, or would otherwise like to contribute to Wanderlost + Found please contact me directly to discuss how we might collaborate.
    </p><br><br>
