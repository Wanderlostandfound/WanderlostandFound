      <p>Hi, I’m Jenn and I have a confession to make. I feel more at home in faraway airports than I do in my own city. I’m more comfortable surrounded by strangers speaking foreign languages than I am when surrounded by people speaking English. I miss my friends and family when I’m not with them, but I miss the world even more when I’m not out there exploring it. I’m addicted to meeting new people and crave that connection you sometimes make with new friends that is only possible because you just happen to be in the same place, at the same time, and you’re both just there doing exactly what you wanted to be doing at that time. I’m always happy to arrive home, do a load of laundry and sleep in my own bed, but within days I’m antsy and restless, and constantly thinking about the next great place to go visit. Yes, it’s true: I have a major case of worldwide travel FOMO. I’m beginning to think it’s incurable. and I’m okay with that, even if many of my family and friends can’t understand it.

      I travelled a bit during my university years, thanks in part to student loans that I spent on plane tickets instead of textbooks. A week in Hawaii one year, some time in Cuba the next, but what really made me realize that going out and exploring the world was the best thing in the entire world was during the 3 months I spent backpacking with my boyfriend from Egypt to Ireland one summer. It was my first real taste of independant travel, and it was a bit scary sometimes, but we figured it out on our own and often without being able to use language to communicate with the people around us. (and this was before the age of smartphones no less!) Wait a minute, that's a thing in real life?! Can people actually get by with hand gestures, miming, and some smiles? Can people actually trust and count on the kindess of strangers? YES! Yes, they can! It was awesome and I was officially hooked.
      <br><br>
      After university I was lucky enough to land a good job with an even better schedule. I worked FIFO from Northern Canada, a rotation of 2 weeks at a remote mine site in the NWT followed by 2 weeks off to do whatever (or go wherever) I wanted. I had lots of chances to travel during this time, checked a few more countries off my travel bucketlist, and met a ton of amazing people, many of whom I still call friends. Fast forward a few more years (and a few life changing events we won't get into here), and I found myself quitting my job and moving my life to Australia, where I now currently reside with my husband aka "partner in crime." Content creation and web development support my wanderlust these days, and I'm still always planning trips and dreaming about my next big adventure.
      <br><br>
      Every trip I take, even to places I've visited before, teaches me new things about the world and about myself. I've learned to trust myself and my own gut instincts more. I've learned to appreciate my life and the people in it, but also to not be afraid to make a change to either when something isn't bringing me the happiness it once was. Most importantly, I've learned to ignore the messages we seem to constantly be bombarded by these days. It is entirely okay to be open to whatever happens next, you don't need to always have everything planned out. It is okay to trust strangers and believe that people are generally pretty damn good on the inside. And it's okay to be lost. In the (paraphrased) words of Henry David Thoreau - not until we are lost do we begin to find ourselves.
