Wanderlust, that feeling of wanting to pick up, leave on the next plane (or train), and just go somewhere completely new and unknown is always with me. It's that nagging little voice inside my head saying "wouldn't it be nice to be sitting on a beach somewhere right now?" Or "wouldn't it be so cool to be hiking through that mountain pass instead of staring at your computer monitor?" Sometimes my inner travel-addicted soul whispers these things softly, sweet suggestions that make surviving the work day a little easier. But then I scroll through Instagram and see a post from some exotic and awe-inspiring location and those whispers turn into an immediate and deep-rooted wanting to walk out the door and pack my bag for the next adventure.<br><br>

If you're anything like me, you've definitely felt that same longing for adventure. And if you're also like me, you know that daydreams rarely pay the bills, and you probably can't just yell "see ya" to the boss on your way out the door (at least not until your next approved vacation). Instead, here are 17 travel quotes that will definitely feed your wanderlust, and maybe help you get through that workday that just won't ever end.<br><br>

I think my life’s ambition is to see a yak. I want to bargain for trinkets in an Arab market in some distant, dusty land. There’s so much."
</blockquote> <span class="padded3">- Lisa Ann Sandell</span>
