The world's "Most Liveable City" isn't exactly known for being a budget destination where you can stretch your dollars (let's face it, nowhere in Australia really is). But Melbourne is an amazing city jam-packed with a ton of things to do and see, and lots of it is completely free! You can easily spend a few days exploring the city, soaking in Melbourne's pervasive and eclectic culture, and seeing the sights without breaking the bank. Save your dollars for Melbourne's famous coffee instead, by checking out these free, but fantastic, attractions:<br><br>



<div class="padded3">
  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> City Circle Tourist Tram</h6></b>
  This free tram is a great way to get your bearings around Melbourne's Central Business District. It passes by many of the city's tourist attractions, and the tram plays a recorded commentary along the way, giving you some insight into the area and it's sights. Trams depart 10am-6pm Sunday-Wednesday, and 10am-9pm Thursday-Saturday in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions approximately every 12 minutes. Jump off and on anywhere along the route: Flinders Street-Spring Street-Nicholson Street-Victoria Parade-La Trobe Street-Docklands Drive-Harbour Esplanade-Flinders Street.<br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> State Library of Victoria</h6></b>
  Two million books grace the shelves of this impressive library, and those aren't the only treasures you'll find here. Various exhibitions can be found throughout, including the armour of Ned Kelley himself, and often there are free talks held here too. The beautiful building is worth a wander all on its own, and don't forget to spend some time taking in the atmosphere in the totally epic domed reading room. There's free wifi here too, if you need to get connected. 176 Little Lonsdale Street.
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> National Gallery of Victoria (NGV)</h6></b>
  The permanent collections here are always free to view with art works ranging from classical to contemporary, as well as some traditional Aboriginal works too. There's a beautiful stained glass atrium in the center of the building, and lots of hidden gems to be found within the corridors. 180 St. Kilda Road.
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Explore for Street Art in Melbourne's Laneways</h6></b>
  The main streets of Melbourne's CBD might be laid out in a grid, but the laneways are a labyrinth of potential treasures. Small cafes, bars, and shops can be found hidden down many of the city's laneways, as well as colourful street art and graffiti. A few locations are officially "sanctioned" places for artists to show off their talents, such as Hosier Lane and AC/DC Lane, but if you look carefully, many great work can be found. Start at Hosier Lane, across from Federation Square, and work your way up from there towards Chinatown. You can also checkout the suburbs of Fitzroy and Brunswick for some more art if you're looking to explore outside of the CBD.
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Royal Botanic Gardens</h6></b>
  There are over 8,500 plant species here, spread out over 28 hectares of lush gardens. There's a big lake, jogging track, and a multitude of picnic spots, making the gardens the perfect place to relax and enjoy an afternoon in the sun. Birdwood Ave.
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI)</h6></b>
  A museum dedicated to Australian film history, ACMI offers an interactive journey through the evolution of moving art from zoetrope to modern video games. Upstairs, you can watch movies from the National Film Archives. Located in Federation Square.

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Shrine of Remembrance</h6></b>
  The Shrine of Remembrance is an impressive memorial built in 1934. You can climb the stairs up to the balcony for breathtaking views of the Melbourne CBD, then head down to the crypt to explore the Galleries of Remembrance.

  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Get Your Tan On at the Beach</h6></b>
  St. Kilda is the closest beach to the city, but if you take the Sandringham Line out a bit further to the Brighton Beach stop you'll find the iconic bathing boxes that perfectly frame views of the city skyline. Each bathing box is decked out in colourful paint, and no box is the same as any other. If you take the train all the way out to Sandringham Station, you'll find some of Melbourne's best city beaches, with soft sand and clear water.
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> People Watching at Federation Square</h6></b>
  There is almost always something happening at the unmistakable Federation Square, opposite of Flinders Street Station. Plenty of seating space is available, and Melbournians often choose this landmark as a meeting place themselves. It's a fantastic spot to chill out and do some people watching.  
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Wander the Markets</h6></b>
  Queen Victoria Market is probably the most well-known market in the city, and it's definitely worth a wander. This market stands on the site of what was Melbourne's first cemetery and has gone through a few iterations before officially opening as the Queen Victoria Market in 1878. But Melbourne has a few other markets that are also well worth your time. South Melbourne, Prahran, and Dandenong Markets are also popular. Wandering through is free, but what you end up spending on all the fantastic finds is up to you!
  <br><br><br>

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Melbourne Town Hall</h6></b>
  Learn about the architectural, social, and political significance of the Melbourne Town Hall on a free tour offered each weekday except for Tuesdays. You'll have to call ahead to book a spot, 03 9658 9658, as only 10 people are taken on each tour. Sit in the Lord Mayor's chair, view the Grand Organ dating from 1929, or stand on the portico where The Beatle's waved to their adoring fans. 90-130 Swanston Street.

  <b><h6><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Free Walking Tour of the CBD</h6></b>
  Take a 3 hour tour around Melbourne's landmarks with a free walking tour, offered by I'm Free Walking Tours. The tours depart twice daily, at 10:30am and 2:30pm, rain, hail, or shine, so make sure you dress appropriately for Melbourne's famously inconsistent weather.

Meet your guide, who will be wearing a bright green T-shirt, at the statue of Sir Redmond Barry in front of the State Library of Victoria.
  <br><br><br>
